# iris_classification
MATLAB Classification Neural Network trained on the iris dataset. 

This is a model that identifies if a plant is a Setosa, Versicolor or Virginica flower based on the sepal width, sepal length, petal width and petal length. 
This is a classification problem. 
First, the dataset is modified to use label encoding, converting categorical labels into numerical representations, to facilitate better compatibility with machine learning algorithms.
Two models for this problem are built, one using the linear discriminant analysis (LDA) and one using the Levenberg-Marquardt (LM) backpropagation algorithm.
The LM model also explores the effect of varying topologies on the model's performance.
